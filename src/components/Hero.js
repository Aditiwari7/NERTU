            Osmania University is a collegiate public state university located
            in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Mir Osman Ali Khan, the 7th Nizam of
            Hyderabad, issued a firman calling for its creation on 29 August
            1917. It is the third oldest university in southern India, and the
            first to be established in the erstwhile Kingdom of Hyderabad.
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the first Indian university to use Urdu as a language
            of instruction, although with English as a compulsory subject. As of
            2012, the university hosts 3,700 international students from more
            than 80 nations.
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Osmania is one of the largest university systems in the world with
            over 300,000 students on its campuses and affiliated colleges. The
            Osmania Medical College was once a part of the Osmania University
            System. However, it is now under the supervision of Kaloji Narayana
            Rao University of Health Sciences.

            <div style={{ textAlign:"justify" }}>In 1917, Sir Akbar Hydari, in a memorandum to the Education
            Minister, emphasized the need to establish a university in Hyderabad
            with Urdu as the medium of instruction, "as it is the language of
            the widest currency in India". On April 26, 1917, the Nizam of
            Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan issued a firman to establish the
            Osmania University.
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The university began functioning in 1918 in a building
            adjacent to the Nizam College at Basheerbagh. Arts and theology were
            the only two faculties offered, and the first batch consisted of 225
            students and 25 faculty members.
            <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The government invited Patrick Geddes and Edwin Jasper to set up a
            permanent campus of the university. Geddes surveyed prospective
            locations and presented his report in 1923. Jasper drew up the
            building plans and the Nizam laid the foundation stone for the
            campus on July 5, 1934. After Jasper left Hyderabad, the state
            architect Zain Yar Jung supervised the construction of the campus.</div>
